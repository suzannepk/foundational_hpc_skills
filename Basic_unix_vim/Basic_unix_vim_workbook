# Purpose

This challenge is going to show you the very basic Unix and Vim skills you need to work on the Hands-On HPC Challenges. 
If you have any experience working with Vim or Unix, you can skip this challenge.



# Working in a Unix System

In order to accomplish tasks in any high-performance computing system, you need to know how to navigate
through and issue commands in a Unix or Linux operating system. In these operating systems, all
interactions you have with the computer will be done via the issuing of text based commands, as opposed
to clicking on graphical images in order to augment files or run programs.


In this section you will learn about the command line and how to list files in your current directory, 
make directories, change from one directory to another, and copy and remove files.


## The command line

The command line (also called a command prompt) is a text interface for a computer. It is the place 
in which you type the commands that will be interpreted and executed by the computer when you enter 
them. From the command line, you can run programs and navigate through files and folders just like 
you would with Windows Explorer on Windows or Finder on MacOS. 

Here is an example of a command line prompt:

```
[suzanne@login1.ascent ~]$
```
The prompt here is the "$". Your commands will be typed after it. 

The system in this example has been set up so the user's userID and the name of the login node and system are d
isplayed in brackets before the prompt.
Not all systems will have this feature. Some will just start with the "$"
